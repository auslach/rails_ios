Location-based mobility apps are a central part of any modern product's strategy more than ever before. Heroku's simple deployment process and handling of server-side complexities makes it an ideal platform for the backing APIs that power these types of apps.

## Deploying to Heroku

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/heroku/devcenter-ios-geophoto-api.git
  $ cd devcenter-ios-geophoto-api
  $ heroku create --stack cedar

```
